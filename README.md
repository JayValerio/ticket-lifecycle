  First, lets create some tickets to work on!
</p>

</p>
<p>
  For this example we will create 3 different tickets and will close them using the Users and Agents we created in our last 2 projects.
</p>

<p>
  Next we will sign into our Agent account (Jorge Doe) to resolve the ticket.

</p>

<p>
  Once you sign in you can see the Tickets that have been sent through the system. Since Jorge is configured in the "Support" department, he is able to view all of the tickets because that department provides him the permission to do so.

</p>
<p>
  Lets use our first ticket to understand what we are looking at.

<p>Status: The current status of the ticket, you can click here to resolve/close the ticket.</p>
<p>Priority: Allows you to set the priority level of the ticket (Low, Normal, High, Emergency).</p>
<p>Assigned To: This allows you to assign an Agent/Team To the ticket.</p>
<p>SLA Plan:: Allows us to set the SLA for the Ticket.</p>
<p>User,Email, Source: Shows who sent the ticket and how.</p>
<p>Help Topic: Allows us to see or change the topic of the ticket.</p>
<p>Ticket Thread: Allows us to respond/view messages to/from the user who submitted the ticket.</p>
<p>Tasks: Allows us to view/set tasks for the ticket.</p>
</p>
