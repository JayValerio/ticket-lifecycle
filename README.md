  First, lets create some tickets to work on!
</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>
  For this example we will create 3 different tickets and will close them using the Users and Agents we created in our last 2 projects.
</p>

<p>
  Next we will sign into our Agent account (Jorge Doe) to resolve the ticket.

</p>

<p>
  Once you sign in you can see the Tickets that have been sent through the system. Since Jorge is configured in the "Support" department, he is able to view all of the tickets because that department provides him the permission to do so.
</p>

<h1>Ticket 1</h1>
<br />
<br />
<p>

</p>
<p>
  <h3>Lets use our first ticket to understand what we are looking at.</h3>

<p>Status: The current status of the ticket, you can click here to resolve/close the ticket.</p>
<p>Priority: Allows you to set the priority level of the ticket (Low, Normal, High, Emergency).</p>
<p>Department: Allows us to see/set the dapartment this ticket has been assigned to.</p>
<p>Assigned To: This allows you to assign an Agent/Team To the ticket.</p>
<p>SLA Plan:: Allows us to set the SLA for the Ticket.</p>
<p>User,Email, Source: Shows who sent the ticket and how.</p>
<p>Help Topic: Allows us to see or change the topic of the ticket.</p>
<p>Ticket Thread: Allows us to respond/view messages to/from the user who submitted the ticket.</p>
<p>Tasks: Allows us to view/set tasks for the ticket.</p>
</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>
  Here we addressed the Ticket using our "Jorge" account, observe the changes from the initial ticket to when we started working on the ticket. Since "Jenny" is a part of the App team she is who we assigned the ticket to. Now we log in as Jenny to finish this ticket.  
</p>

<p>
  Here we simply addressed the issue with our client, notified them the issue has been resolved and then we close the ticket.
</p>

<br />
<h1>Ticket 2</h1>
<br />
<br />
<p>

  <p>
    Here we have a ticket that at first seemed like it could have been a serious problem. The idea here is we asked our client to clarify "how many agents" were unable to use the system. Once we had more information and found out that the only 2 agents with this issue had not update their computers. We were able to address the ticket accordingly and have the agents update their computers to fix the issue.

<p>
  Note the changes in the ticket after clarifying issue.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Now we can close the ticket.

<h1>Ticket 3</h1>
<br />
<br />
<p>

</p>
<p>
 The last ticket is rather simple but looks important because it is coming from a Higher-up client.
